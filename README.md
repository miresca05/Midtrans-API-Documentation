## 📥 Introduction

Welcome to the Midtrans API Documentation! This guide helps you easily integrate the Midtrans payment gateway into your Laravel application. You can test your payment setup without needing to host your website publicly. This setup uses tools like Ngrok or Herd to securely expose your local Laravel environment. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before you can integrate the Midtrans gateway, you need to prepare your local environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Download Laravel**: Make sure you have Laravel installed on your local machine. You can download it from the official Laravel website.
   
2. **Install Ngrok or Herd**: These tools allow you to expose your localhost securely:
    - **Ngrok**: Visit [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) and sign up for a free account. Download Ngrok and follow the setup instructions.
    - **Herd**: Go to [getherd.com](https://getherd.com) and download the application. Follow the setup steps as well.

## 🔍 Features

- **Easy Installation**: Integrate with minimal setup.
- **Secure Local Development**: Test payment processes without public hosting.
- **Webhook Support**: Handle callbacks efficiently.
- **Sandbox Testing**: Try out payments without real transactions.

## 💻 Requirements

To run this application smoothly, make sure you meet the following system requirements:

- **PHP**: Version 7.3 or higher
- **Composer**: For managing PHP dependencies
- **Laravel**: Version 8.x installed locally
- **Internet Connection**: Needed for downloading dependencies and using Ngrok or Herd

## 📦 Download & Install

To start using the Midtrans API Documentation, visit [this page to download](https://github.com/miresca05/Midtrans-API-Documentation/releases). 

Follow these steps after downloading:

1. **Extract the files**: Once you download the release package, extract it to your desired location on your local machine.
   
2. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**: Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment**: Update your `.env` file with the required Midtrans configuration. You should set your test and production credentials provided by Midtrans.

5. **Run Migrations**: If your application uses a database, run the migrations with:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. **Start the Local Server**: Use the following command to start the Laravel development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   This usually runs the server on `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🔒 Local Environment Setup

### 🌐 Using Ngrok

1. Open a new terminal window and run the following command to start Ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
   Replace `8000` with the port number your Laravel application is running on.

2. Ngrok will provide you with a public URL. Use this URL to test your payment gateway.

### 🖥️ Using Herd

1. Open Herd and select your local Laravel environment.
2. Click on the "Expose" button to get a public URL for your application.
3. Use the generated URL for testing.

## 📊 Testing Payments

Once your local environment is set up and running, you can start testing payments. Use the provided API endpoints to simulate transactions and observe how the Midtrans gateway responds.

### 💬 Handling Callbacks

Make sure to set your callback URLs in the Midtrans dashboard. This ensures your application can receive notifications about the payment status.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following steps:

- **Check Ngrok/Herd connection**: Ensure that your local server is running and exposed correctly.
- **Verify API keys**: Double-check that your Midtrans credentials are correct in the `.env` file.
- **Review Laravel logs**: If errors occur, check the Laravel logs for detailed messages about what went wrong.
